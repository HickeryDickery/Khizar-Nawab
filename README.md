Clone the repository and run the command `npm i` followed by `npm run dev` in the terminal of the root directory.  
Open `http://localhost:5173` in your browser.

## Note

The contact form will not work out-of-the-box.  
For that you need to setup your own account on EmailJS and use the corresponding SERVICE ID, TEMPLATE ID and PUBLIC KEY.  
Add these keys to a `.env` file and name them according to the variables used in `Contact.jsx`.
